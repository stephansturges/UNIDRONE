## Features
- :sparkles: **YOLOV8-based** – the AI models shared are all based on the populat YOLO architecture and are, as such, very easy to integrate into products and deploy on all sorts of inference hardware including at the edge
- :zap: **Open weights** – all the models are shared as .pt files and can be used as starting points for training / finetuning the networks on your own data! 
- :bulb: **Angle-agnostic** – the training data for these models is a new set which looks to merge WALDO and NANO, two other drone-centric AI systems that I maintain, but reducing the output size for more mainstream use-cases and expanding the training-data scope to ensure the models work better at **any** angle from top-down (nadir imagery) to horizontal (looking forward).

## Installation

1. Clone this repo to get the sample code, and pull the weights from Hugginface at: 

## Usage

See the demo code in this repo to run some examples.
To get started you can perform inference on an input mp4 video using:


## Contributing

Please feel free to write a PR if you'd like to add features to the sample code here or want to build a complete deployment pipeline for a specific platform for instance!
